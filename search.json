Our results show that regular water collection and inexpensive stable isotope measurements can indicate changes in the lake’s inputs and outputs. We established an ongoing sampling program with collaborators at the Turkana Basin Institute and PERMILab at the Mpala Research Centre. We also published precipitation records from entries kept at Turkana Basin Institute facilities."
