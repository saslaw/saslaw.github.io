I discovered making websites as a stress response the first time I scrolled through themes on Angelfire. It's usually productive, I get to make as many choices as I want, and in times of overwhelming possibility, I always feel like I might need a new website where I'm going. In twenty years I have written a lot of first posts. I am doing it again.
